                            From a young age I have always had a fascination with computers and the way they work. I was often found in my free time disassembling, reassembling machines, or following tech related tutorials on YouTube. As I developed my skills began learning how to build websites and became very familiar with WordPress and modifying it to do what I wanted.<br><br>
                             I while in college I pursued other interests and studied criminal justice and marketing but always maintained my love for computers. It was during this time that I did a lot of freelance web development work. I collaborated with other developers and graphic designers to build websites for clients that always exceeded their expectations. My experience as a freelance developer helped me hone my skills with HTML, CSS, JS, WordPress, Pay Per Click advertising, Facebook Marketing, SEO and much more.<br><br>
                            After college, with a CJ degree I gained employment with a local law enforcement agency. I still stayed observant with developments in web tech but was far less involved. After being out of web development for some time I got the itch to start building things on the web again. In 2020 I took a Web Development Fundamentals class as a refresher, and found I still love web dev.<br><br>
                            This year I took a full plunge and enrolled in a full stack web development bootcamp and have had hands on experience with tech that has been a game-changer for my coding abilities. Adding bootstrap, React, Node, Express, and MongoDB to my Web Development Toolkit have me excited for the countless possibilities.
